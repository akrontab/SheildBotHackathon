documentation for our music box!!!
------------------------------------

Ok seriously... Documentation??!?!? I've had to pee for more than 3 hours!!! My kidneys hate me ;)

it's Been fun! I hope these unrefined docs will shed some light on the maddness that happened.



The musicbot folder contains code to make the shieldbot a music bot.

The led fade folder contians the code to fade leds for visualizations


Cheers!!!
